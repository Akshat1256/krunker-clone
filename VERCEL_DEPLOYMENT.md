## üîß Vercel Configuration

### vercel.json (Already Created)
Your project now has a `vercel.json` file that optimizes the deployment:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server.js"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  },
  "functions": {
    "server.js": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

## üéÆ After Deployment

### Test Your Game
1. **Open the Vercel URL** in your browser
2. **Test single-player mode** - should work perfectly
3. **Test multiplayer mode** - may have WebSocket issues
4. **Share URL with friends** for testing

### If Multiplayer Doesn't Work
If WebSockets don't work properly on Vercel:
1. **Deploy to Railway** (500h/month free, full WebSocket support)
2. **Deploy to Render** (750h/month free, full WebSocket support)
3. **Both have 100GB bandwidth** and no credit card required

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check Vercel logs in dashboard
# Common fixes:
1. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
2. Verify build script works locally: npm run build
3. Check if server.js exists and is correct
4. Make sure vercel.json is in project root
```

### WebSocket Issues
- **Vercel limitation:** Serverless functions don't support persistent WebSocket connections
- **Solution:** Deploy to Railway or Render for full WebSocket support
- **Alternative:** Use Vercel for frontend + external WebSocket service

### Game Doesn't Load
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all static files are being served
- Check Vercel function logs in dashboard

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Auto-deploy:** Every push to GitHub triggers a new deployment
2. **Custom domains:** Add your own domain in Vercel settings
3. **Performance:** Vercel's global CDN provides fast loading
4. **Monitoring:** Check Vercel dashboard for usage and performance
5. **Rollback:** Easy to rollback to previous deployments
